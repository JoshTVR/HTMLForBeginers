        The Bush team has now created the very monster that it conjured up to
        alarm Americans into backing a war on Iraq.

        <p>Rushing to pummel Iraq after 9/11, Bush officials ginned up links
            between Saddam and Al Qaeda. They made it sound as if Islamic
            fighters on a jihad against America were slouching toward Baghdad to
            join forces with murderous Iraqis.</p>

        <p>There was scant evidence of it then, but it's coming true now.</p>

        <p>Since America began its occupation, Iraq has become the mecca for
            every
            angry, hate-crazed Arab extremist who wants to liberate the Middle
            East
            from the ''despoiling'' grasp of the infidels.</p>

        <p>''Increasing numbers of Saudi Arabian Islamists are crossing the border into Iraq, in preparation for a jihad, or holy war, against U.S. and U.K. forces, security and Islamist sources have warned,'' The Financial Times said yesterday, quoting a Saudi dissident who noted that Saudi authorities are concerned that ''up
            to 3,000 Saudi men have gone 'missing' in the kingdom in two
            months.''</p>
