# What is HTML?

The language we are learning is HTML, or HyperText Markup Language. It was created by a developer named Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.

Today, every website in the world uses HTML!

As the name suggests, HTML is a markup language; it marks up every piece of content on a web page and defines its type. Pretty simple and perfect for beginners!

However, HTML is just one piece used to build a web page. Most web pages use:

---

![File type HTML](/Images//Icons/file-type-html.226x256.png)

HTML: Create the website skeleton.

![File type CSS](/Images//Icons/file-type-css.226x256.png)

CSS: Modify the website appearance.

![JavaScript Logo](/Images//Icons/javascript-original.256x256.png)

JavaScript: Make it interactive.

This repository will focus on HTML to build a strong foundation.

The programs we write will be files with the extension .html.
