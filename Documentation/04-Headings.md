# Headings

Let's look at some more elements.

Suppose we want to add a headline to our website that displays a news article. Here's how we would do it using a `<h1>` heading element and a `<p>` paragraph element:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Breaking News ðŸš¨</h1>
  <p>Florida man once evaded arrest by cartwheeling now running for mayor.</p>
</body>
```

There are six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`:

```html
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>
```

Here's the result:

> Note: Only one `<h1>` element should be used in a .html file.

## Line Break

Suppose we also want to add a new line within a paragraph element. Pressing enter won't do us any good because HTML ignores multiple spaces and line breaks within elements.

So we must use the `<br>` break tag here!

The `<br>` break tag adds a line break:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Breaking News</h1>
  <p>
    Florida man robs convenience store with an alligator.<br />Leaves a baby
    Crocs behind.
  </p>
</body>
```

A **self-closing** tag doesn't need to be closed manually by a closing tag... it does not have a separate closing </tag>. The break tag is the first one we have encountered.

The final code will become:
